# How to Solve it

In selecting an presenting problems, there are two main objectives:

1. Each problem should be simple to state and understand, and thus problems requiring several or complicated definitions are not include. Only a few of the problems have the character of a broad research program; most of them are specific questions. 
2. The history of the problems, and the credit for them and for the results presented, should be as accurate and complete as possible.
